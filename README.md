Work from the subject Internet of Things - Security system for burglary detection. 

COMPONENTS
• NodeMCU/Arduino Uno
• Breadboard 
• LEDs
•Cables
• Pir module sensor
• Piezo buzzer

The project will serve to detect a potential burglar in the apartment/house and will notify the user
through a web application. When the PIR module sensor detects movement, the alarm will be activated (piezo
buzzer) and the user will be notified that it is a burglary. The web application will also
sound an audible alarm. The user will have the option to enable or disable the system with the goal
so that the alarm would not be activated during the day and the like. Firebase will be used for the database. The project
will be presented as a simulation using Tinkercad, a microcontroller simulation tool, while the
use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a web application.
